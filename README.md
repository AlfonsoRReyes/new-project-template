# A New Project Template

Here is one way to organize your project folders:

	/code
	/data
	/docs
	/output

	README.md
	(reports)
	(shell script or similar describing all code)
	

Originally, this was meant for data science'y projects using mostly R and/or
Python, but do what you want!


# Advanced

If you want more directories, see the `advanced` branch.
